# UWUVCI-Compatibility
Repository that stores Compatibility Information for the UWUVCI Website

The Compatibility Lists will be stored as JSON files.
You can either update said JSON Files per Hand, or use the UWUVCI Discord bot to submit Information.

Those JSON Files will be used by the new [UWUVCI Website](https://uwuvci-prime.github.io/UWUVCI-Website/) to Display the Compatibility List.
The Source Code for the UWUVCI Website can be found [here](https://github.com/UWUVCI-PRIME/UWUVCI-Website).
